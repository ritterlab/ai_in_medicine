2. Insert to URL of this GitHub repository (https://github.com/ritterlab/ai_in_medicine) in the GitHub repository field.
3. Click on the 'launch' button to create a Docker image of the environment.
4. Select the relevant Jupyter notebook for the tutorial.

Binder allows only a memory of 2GB per container, you have to use a copy of the COVID-19 dataset for your tutorial. Moreover, Binder does not offer GPU support.


### Jupyter Notebooks (local)
It is recommended to install the Anaconda Distribution which is a Python/R data science distribution and a collection of over 7,500+ open-source packages including a package and environment manager.  Please follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) for the local installation.

1. After the installation you can either clone the GitHub repository or download the repository as a zip-file by clicking on the green `Code` button and selecting `Donwload ZIP`
